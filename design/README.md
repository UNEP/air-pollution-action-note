# Design
Should we open our Figma file to everyone that wants a peak? You can explore [Figma file here](https://www.figma.com/file/majnnQyQupv1DO3rtgAtJP/UNEP-Air-Pollution-Action-Note?node-id=0%3A1)


## Demers, tile grid maps and an Indian dessert

They were created using Barfi, an in-house interactive tool to create square (Demers) cartograms using a force-directed layout. It spun off a collaboration with the United Nations Environment Programme and a good bunch of design restrictions when visualizing data about the climate crisis.

You can read about it here. But it a nutshell:  

> Taking these restrictions into account, we decided to opt for two types of grammatically related  visualizations: tile grid maps and Demers cartograms (Bortins et al., 2002).
> 
> In tile grid maps, admin divisions become cells arranged on a grid that fits their geographic layout. Each cell allows multiple possibilities: a class can be displayed by color, a line plot to show a time trend, a histogram > to show a statistical distribution, or a broken bar to show parts of a total.
> 
> In Demers cartograms, admin units are visually coded as squares and geography is approximated. The visual mark, the square in this case, allows you to encode a numerical variable through area and a categorical variable through color.
> 
> Another advantage of this design solution is the use of the same visual mark, in this case squares, which allows us to create transitions between maps that facilitate a fluid sequential narrative.

You can also see us [talking about it at the SIGLibre conference](http://diobma.udg.edu/handle/10256.1/6776) â€” we are planning to open it up once our to-do list is ... well ... done.

## Color scales
- [ ] Inclusive color in dataviz
- [ ] Chroma.js
- [ ] Viz palette reports

## Interaction design
- [ ] Very simple navigation, stack of cartograms
- [ ] All components are explorable
- [ ] Legends are interactive
- [ ] Interactives are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Structure of the cartograms

````svelte
<div class="countries"
  role="graphics-document"
  aria-label={title}>
  {#each cartogramData as d (d.code)}
    {#if d.x && d.y}
      <div
        class="country {classesFn(d).join(' ')}"
        style={calcStyle(d)}
        data-code={d.code}
        tabindex="0"
        role="graphics-object"
        on:mouseenter={(evt) => onMouseEnterCountry(evt, d)}
        on:mouseleave={() => onMouseLeaveCountry()}
        on:focus={() => onMouseClick(d)}
        on:blur={() => onMouseLeaveCountry()}
      >
      <desc>{hoverTextFn(d)}</desc>
      {#if !hideLabels && d.width > 100}
        <span class="country-text">{d.short}</span>
      {/if}
      </div>
    {/if}
  {/each}
</div>
